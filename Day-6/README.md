Day 6: Mastering CSS Properties and Values

On Day 6 of #100DaysOfCode challenge, I took a deep dive into the captivating world of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Today's focus is on understanding CSS properties and their values.

â€¢ CSS Unleashed: Styling the Web
CSS is where we add the magic to our web creations. It stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's the language of web design. With CSS, we have the power to control the presentation and layout of our HTML elements.

â€¢ Properties and Values: The Building Blocks
CSS properties are like the tools in our design toolkit, and each property has specific values we can assign to it. For example:

âœ“ color: blue; sets the text color to blue.
âœ“ font-size: 16px; controls the size of our text.
âœ“ margin: 20px; defines the spacing around an element.

Understanding how to use properties and values effectively is the key to creating beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly web pages.

So, let's keep the CSS journey rolling! If you have any questions or cool CSS tricks to share, feel free to drop them here. ðŸ˜„

Happy coding, everyone!
