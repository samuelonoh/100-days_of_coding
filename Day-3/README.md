*Day 3: Transitioning to HTML Graphics*

Day 3 of my 100 Days of Code is here, and I'm excited to share my progress. I've wrapped up HTML tags and attributes and I'm all set to dive into HTML graphics tomorrow.
Here's a quick recap:

- <progress> tag: For visualizing progress.

- <ruby> tag: For annotating text with finesse.

- <script> tag: For unleashing scripting magic.

- <source> tag: For ensuring multimedia flexibility.

- <span> tag: For mastering text styling.

- <sub> tag: For handling subscripts well.

Stay tuned as we step into the realm of HTML graphics for more creative discoveries!
