Day 2: Mastering HTML Tags and Attributes.
Hi everyone! On day 2 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I continued learning about HTML tags and attributes.

Here are some of the ones I learnt about, today:
📝 The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph. It adds a blank line before and after each paragraph, and can be aligned using the align attribute.

📝 The <pre> tag is used to define a block of preformatted text. This means that the text will be displayed exactly as it is written, including spaces and line breaks.

📝 HTML phrasing tags are used to add emphasis or structure to text. Some of these tags include <abbr>, <strong>, <em>, etc.

📝 The <abbr> tag is used to abbreviate a word or phrase. It has a title attribute that can be used to define the full textl of the abbreviation.

📝 The <acronym> tag is used to define an acronym. It has a title attribute that can be used to define the full text of the acronym.

📝 The <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction. It has a dir attribute that can be used to set the text direction to left-to-right (ltr), right-to-left (rtl), or auto.

📝 The <blockquote> tag is used to quote text. It has a cite attribute that can be used to specify the source of the quoted text.

📝 The <code> tag is used to display programming code. It has no attributes.

I'm excited to continue learning more about HTML tags and attributes in the days to come. Stay tuned for more coding revelations!
