I am excited to announce that I started my #100DaysOfCodeChallenge, today. Today, I delved into the fundamentals of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). Here are some of the key concepts I learned:

DOCTYPE declaration: This is an opening statement that ensures our web pages are displayed as intended. By including <!DOCTYPE html>, we set the stage for impeccable rendering and a seamless user experience.

HTML structure: The <html> tag envelopes our entire web content, while the <head> section houses vital metadata such as the document's title, character set, and references to styles and scripts. This duo forms the backbone that we build captivating web experiences.

The <body> tag: The true magic of a webpage unfolds within the <body> tag. It's where I learned to bring content to life – from text to multimedia – creating an immersive digital canvas that engages visitors.

Text formatting: The <p> tag allows us to structure text into coherent paragraphs, while the <br> tag introduces subtle line breaks within paragraphs, enhancing readability and aesthetics.

Dividing content: The <hr> tag proved to be an elegant solution for dividing content. This horizontal line serves as a visual cue, signalling shifts in topic or focus, enhancing overall organisation.

Embedding images: The <img> tag enabled me to seamlessly embed images into my pages. Attributes like 'src' defines image sources, 'alt' ensures accessibility, and width/height control dimensions, perfecting the visual narrative.

HTML attributes: HTML attributes allow us to infuse personality into elements. The 'id' attribute brings uniqueness, 'title' unveils informative tooltips, 'href' facilitates seamless navigation, 'style' enables bespoke designs, and 'lang' caters to diverse audiences.

I am enthusiastic to continue learning about HTML and other coding languages, and look forward to sharing more of my progress with you in the days to come.

Thank you for being a part of my coding odyssey!
