Day 5: Wrapping Up the HTML Journey and Starting the CSS Adventure

Day 5 marks the conclusion of my HTML journey in the #100DaysOfCode challenge and the exciting beginning of our CSS adventure. Here's a quick recap:

- HTML Mastery: I delved deep into HTML, unraveling tags, attributes, and their incredible capabilities.

- Structuring Brilliance: Tables, lists, blocks, inlines, iframes, and input tags enable us to create organized, user-friendly web content.

It's time to bid farewell to our HTML journey, but not to worry, it's merely the end of one chapter and the start of another.

Now, we embark on an exciting journey into the world of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), where we'll bring to life our web creations with style and finesse. Stay tuned for more coding adventures!
